1. Frontend:
A user interface for clients to interact with the map.
Forms for uploading media (photos, videos) and adding shop details.
Map integration (Google Maps or OpenStreetMap).
2. Backend:
API to handle the uploading of media and storing shop information.
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for shop data.
3. Database:
Store shop information, uploaded media, and location data.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or plain JavaScript).
Backend: Node.js with Express.
Database: MongoDB or MySQL.
Cloud Storage: (Optional) For handling large files like images/videos.
I'll create a simple version for you in Node.js (for the backend) and HTML/JavaScript (for the frontend). Here's the plan:

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS):

Map UI to show shop locations.
Form to upload images, videos, and enter shop details.
Backend (Node.js/Express):

REST API for uploading, updating, and deleting shop information and media.
Database (MongoDB):

Store shop data and media file paths.
